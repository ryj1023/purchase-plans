I chose to leverage the Bootstrap 4 library in order to display much of these styles rather than putting all of the CSS
in the stylesheet. For the positioning of the cards, I utilized Bootstrap's grid layout, aligning the container div in 
the center of the page with a 'middle-alignment' class along with the margin set to 'auto'. 
Also, I utilized Bootstrap's layout responsiveness by including the '*-lg' tags in order to change the stack the 
columns whenever the screen size was less than a 'large' screen width.

I chose to use the transform property in order to scale the Platinum card to be 1.05 sizes larger than the dimensions
of the original card. This allowed me to resize while still keeping a consistent dimension.
